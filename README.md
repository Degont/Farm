Ecology simulator using tiles of land and metabolisms 

### Intention
The intention behind this game is to make an ecology simulator, so far I have laid the foundations for the game and the interactions. The thing that I am most proud of for this game is the datastructure
for the tiles. The entire game is built on a tile system that I created, using nested lists with a dictionary for every coordinate point. The dictionary contains information about the tiles inhabitants,
its fill color, the actual rect so that I can place things there and or check if there is something there and the coordinates to reference them based on having the rect. This makes for a robust system 
that serves as the foundation for interactions between the different elements inside the game. 

### Current Status
This game is on pause for now to learn more about unity and C# to develop some mobile games that may be vastly easier than creating an interactive ecosystem garden, however once life and finances allow it,
I plan to return here and continue adding pieces.

Created the base functions, where bunnies eat grass to gain nurtients, grass grows and spawns in relation to rain. Next step is AI for the wolves behaviour. 

### Current Inhabitants 
- Bunnies
- Wolves
- Grass
